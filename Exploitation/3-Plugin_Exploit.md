# Wordpress Plugin Exploit
A WordPress plugin is a piece of software that adds specific features or functionality to a WordPress site, allowing users to extend and customize their websites without altering the core WordPress code. Plugins can range from simple tools, such as adding contact forms or SEO enhancements, to complex systems like e-commerce platforms, security suites, or performance optimizers. They are built using PHP (and often include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and integrate seamlessly with WordPress through its hooks and APIs, making them an essential part of tailoring a site to meet unique needs.
